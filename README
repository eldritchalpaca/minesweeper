This code is a clone of the classic computer game Minesweeper. The game is a 24x12 grid, some of which are hiding bombs.

Non-bomb tiles will show the number of bombs in the 8 tiles surrounding it. Left click a tile to reveal it. Right click a tile to flag it as a bomb. If a tile has the correct number of flags surrounding it, you can middle click it reveal its remaining neighboring tiles.

Additionally, when a tile is middle clicked and held, all surrounding unclicked tiles are highlighted.

The game is won when all bombs are flagged, and is lost when a bomb is left clicked.

There are three modes, the difficulty of which is determined by how many bombs are in the grid. Easy mode has 20 bombs, medium has 30
bombs, and hard has 50 bombs.
